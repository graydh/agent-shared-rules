# Plan Before Act

For non-trivial tasks, create a plan before making changes.

## When to Plan

- Multi-file changes
- Architectural decisions
- New feature implementations
- Complex refactoring
- CI/CD pipeline modifications

## Planning Format

1. **Understand**: Summarize the current state and the goal
2. **Approach**: Outline the high-level approach
3. **Steps**: List specific actions in order
4. **Risks**: Note potential issues or edge cases
5. **Verify**: How to confirm the change worked

## Updating the Plan

If the approach changes during implementation, note what changed and why.

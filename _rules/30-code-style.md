# Code Style

## Readability First

- Prioritize readable code over clever code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for "why", not "what"

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly, don't silently ignore
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with enough context to debug

## Documentation

- Document public APIs and exported functions
- Include usage examples for non-obvious functions
- Keep documentation close to the code
- Update docs when changing functionality
